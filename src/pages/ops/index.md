# Working with HLists and Coproducts {#sec:ops}

In Part I we discussed mechanisms for
deriving type class instances
for algebraic data types using shapeless.
We can use these techniques
to augment almost any type class,
although in more complex cases
we may have to write a lot of supporting code
for manipulating `HLists` and `Coproducts`

In Part II we will look at the `shapeless.ops` package
that provides a set of helpful tools
that we can use as building blocks.
Each op comes in two parts:
a *type class* that we can use during implicit resolution,
and *extension methods* that we can call on `HList` and `Coproduct`.

There are three general sets of ops,
available from three packages:

  - `shapeless.ops.hlist` defines type classes for `HLists`.
    Many can be used directly via extension methods on `HList`,
    defined in `shapeless.syntax.hlist`.

  - `shapeless.ops.coproduct` defines type classes for `Coproducts`.
    Many can be used directly via extension methods on `Coproduct`,
    defined in `shapeless.syntax.coproduct`.

  - `shapeless.ops.record` defines type classes for `HLists`
    whose elements are tagged with key types
    (Section [@sec:labelled-generic:type-tagging]).
    Many can be used directly via extension methods on `HList`,
    defined in `shapeless.syntax.record`.

We don't have room in this book
to cover all of the available ops.
Fortunately, in most cases the code
is understandable and well documented.
Rather than provide an exhaustive guide,
We will touch on
the major theoretical and structural points
and show you how to extract further information
from the shapeless codebase.
